# Attentive Graph Probabilistic Reasoning (GrPR2-A)
Code for implementation of Attentive Graph Probabilistic Reasoning (**<em>GrPR2-A</em>**). Specifically, GrPR2-A constitutes an extension of [FlowComm](https://www.ifaamas.org/Proceedings/aamas2021/pdfs/p456.pdf), supporting level-1 recursive reasoning <em>with communication</em>. 
If any part of this code is used, the following paper must be cited:

## Dependencies
Evaluations were conducted using a 12GB NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU, and:
- Implemented in Python3 with PyTorch v1.7.0.
- Accelerated with Cuda v10.1.
- Situated in the [GymFlock](https://github.com/katetolstaya/gym-flock) flocking environment.

Additional dependencies are:
- [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym)
- [AirSim](https://github.com/openai/gym) (Optional)
